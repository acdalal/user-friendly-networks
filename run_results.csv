Connection issue router,

"Ann WelshJan 6, 2019, 4:46 PM
I have a Linksys E1200 and I am having to do a cold boot (unplug it and replug it in the reset button does not work) to it about every week. I will have internet(wireless) on my device and then one of them will claim that it is not getting signal (connecting, saved, secerd over and over again) I will have signal on the other device (never the same device each time). I cannot look at the settings for the router even when though I still have internet when connected though I can still search the web. I have already updated the firmware. I was wondering what I could do to fix this issue.",

As suggested to you in discord:
1. Reset all settings back to stock, follow the basic setup procedures, do not limit your IP addresses or anything else, let the router's DHCP do the work
2. Ensure the Router's IP address is not within your DHCP range
3. If its still doing this, check the router's settings to ensure the router is releasing assigned IP addresses.
4. You may not get an answer from someone who has used this router here before, it is worth contacting Linksys tech support. There is a possibility that the router has an unfixable issue, and will need to be warrantied or replaced.

Are you saying they are getting conflicting IP addresses?
Ann WelshJan 11, 2019, 2:00 PM
No. Say device 1 has 1.111.1.101 and device two has .102 the issue happens unplug replug device one has 101 device two has 102
Rogue LeaderJan 11, 2019, 2:12 PM
Ok at this point you need Linksys involved, it sounds like your router is defective.

If their tech support hasn't responded, then maybe its time to consider a replacement, and a different brand. I use D-Link and have not had problems.

Not everyone can just go buy a new router aftyer less then having a router less then a year
Gam3r01Jan 11, 2019, 6:15 PM
Routers arent all that expensive.
But on a more important note, if that router is less than a year old then it is most certainly under warranty, which is default 1 year.
Ann WelshJan 11, 2019, 6:19 PM
been told it is not under anything
Gam3r01Jan 11, 2019, 6:20 PM
Call again:

If its under 1 year its covered.

I was tolkd it is not covered because I did not sign up for warrenty with it
Gam3r01Jan 11, 2019, 6:33 PM
Read the warranty terms, you dont have to sign up for anything.

When you say something like ""too old"" after you tell me you contacted linksys and they never contact you back, then you get the assumption that the router is beyond warranty.
As Gamer pointed out the router is still under warranty, clearly you have an issue that can be solved by the warranty.
As for me, I have been helping you since you first asked this question on discord and you have done nothing but ignore me and treat me with disrespect by not even giving me the courtesy of providing me with the complete story or answering my questions.
So, I'm done with you and this thread, call linksys, good luck.

1. Reset all settings back to stock, follow the basic setup procedures, do not limit your IP addresses or anything else, let the router's DHCP do the work I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS AND HAD THE SAME ISSUE
2. Ensure the Router's IP address is not within your DHCP range I HAVE CHECK IT IS NOT IN THE RANGE
3. If its still doing this, check the router's settings to ensure the router is releasing assigned IP addresses. THE DEVICE ARE BEING GIVING THE SAME IP ADDRESS
4. You may not get an answer from someone who has used this router here before, it is worth contacting Linksys tech support. There is a possibility that the router has an unfixable issue, and will need to be warrantied or replaced.",

When you say something like ""too old"" after you tell me you contacted linksys and they never contact you back, then you get the assumption that the router is beyond warranty.
As Gamer pointed out the router is still under warranty, clearly you have an issue that can be solved by the warranty.
